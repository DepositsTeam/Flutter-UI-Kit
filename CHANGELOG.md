* Fixed bug with the table that causes floated items to appear behind fixed columns.
Updated the menu, tooltips and table filter dropdowns to teleport their content to the body dom.
Added a loader to tag dropdown input field
Created an event that gets fired when the tag dropdown options is scrolled to the bottom
Made updates to the switch component to allow true two-way binding for the on and off states
